    The "Catch 'em, Track 'em and Fine 'em" system is a product of ARC
    designed to track the life cycle of a driving offence. 
    Driving offences are defined as offences committed by motorist 
    incurring both penalty points and a fine, or a mandatory court summons.
    Auto-generated lists of offenders requiring driving offence notifications and 
    court summons is a key feature of the system.
